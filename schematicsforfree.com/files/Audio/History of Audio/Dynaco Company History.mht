History</B> </FONT> </P>
<P>David Hafler and his friend Herb Keroes started a Philadelphia, PA =
based=20
company  called <B>Acrosound</B> in 1950, dedicated to building and =
selling=20
audio-quality  output transformers.  Herb's mother invested a =
substantial amount=20
of money in  the company, which apparently didn't return much of a =
profit.   As=20
part of the  marketing of the transformers, and concurrent with Hafler's =
own=20
interests in  audio, they developed and extended the Blumlein =
"Ultralinear"=20
circuit, using  taps from the output transformer to feed signal back =
into the=20
output stage  screen grid circuitry. Numerous homebrew as well as =
commercial=20
hi-fi amplifiers  from the early '50s were based on Acrosound =
transformers. =20
Hafler was  interested in selling entire amplifiers as build-it-yourself =
kits, a=20
somewhat  novel approach in the early '50s.  The average hi-fi =
enthusiast=20
generally started  with a schematic, chose an output transformer (which=20
determined the power of the  final amplifier), selected parts and tubes=20
accordingly, then hand-crafted his  unique component on a homemade =
chassis. =20
Further, Hafler's idea was to supply  preassembled, tested circuit =
boards which=20
only needed to be connected to the  transformers, controls and power =
supply to=20
produce a working unit.  Even the  Heath and Knight units of their day =
generally=20
required the purchaser to assemble  and test the PC boards themselves, a =

time-consuming task.=20
<P>In 1954 Herb and Dave went their separate ways (allegedly due to =
differences=20
of  opinion over kit production and marketing).  During a visit to the =
New=20
 York-based Brociner Electronics (owned by Victor Brociner, whose =
influence in=20
 audio design was also far-reaching) Hafler met up with Ed Laurent who =
had=20
 designed a novel single-tube driver circuit for a power amplifier.  =
More or=20
less  together, they founded the Dyna Company with the intention of not =
only=20
producing  transformers, but high-quality audio circuitry using them.  =
Soon=20
after  incorporation in October 1955 at 617 N. 41st St in Philadelphia, =
Dynaco=20
 announced the Mk. II 50-watt amplifier. Available as a kit or =
preassembled, it=20
 sold for several years, into the 1960s, superseded only by the=20
 soon-to-be-classic Mk. III 60-watt unit. Hafler wrote an article for =20
<I>Radio-Electronics</I> Magazine in 1955 delineating the design of a =
high-power=20
 version of the "Williamson" amplifier using Ultralinear circuitry and =
the new=20
 output transformers.  This amplifier offered a slightly different =
circuit=20
 topology from the Mk. II and Mk. III units soon to appear in Dynaco's =
line, but=20
 showed that the Ultralinear idea was applicable to many amplifiers.  =
Shortly=20
 thereafter, Dynaco moved to 3912 Powelton Ave., where they remained for =
several=20
 years.  Interestingly, the building was the former site of a chocolate=20
 factory, and the old walk-in refrigerator served as a well-isolated =
listening=20
room!=20
<P>Demand for the PAM-1, Mk. II and Mk. III was sufficient for Hafler to =
develop=20
 new offerings; Laurent collaborated with editor par excellence Bob =
Tucker to=20
 produce the legendary Stereo 70 while Hafler was on a business trip.  =
Soon=20
 Dynaco had a handful of high-quality amplifiers and preamplifiers, =
including a=20
 new series of stereo gear, and their first FM tuner -- the FM-1, =
originally a=20
 Stewart Hegeman design "distilled" by Laurent -- in 1961.  A stereo =
adapter=20
 designed by Sid Lidz (at a fraction of the cost of other available =
adapters,=20
 fitting into a specially reserved slot in the FM-1 chassis) and later a =
fully=20
 integrated stereo tuner soon followed. Although Dyna switched to buying =
their=20
 output transformers from a local Philadelphia company, and finally a =
Japanese=20
 source, all were still manufactured to the design specifications =
developed by=20
 Hafler.  Ed Laurent was the chief engineer during these years, and he=20
 contributed to the design of virtually all the vacuum tube circuitry.  =
He and=20
 Bob Tucker followed Hafler's lead in producing simple, reliable, easy =
to=20
 manufacture and assemble electronics and the best manuals in the =
industry.=20
<P>In the mid-1960s, Hafler's company released its first solid-state =
equipment;=20
the  PAT-4 and Stereo 120 pair (again the product of Laurent's expertise =
in=20
circuit  design) made a hit and were well-reviewed by the audio =
magazines.  Not=20
as  collectible today as their tube brethren, these units are still =
remarkable=20
for  their sound quality 35 years later.  During this period, Dynaco =
moved from=20
their  Powelton Ave. location to larger facilities at 3060 W. Jefferson =
St. in=20
 Philadelphia.  Also introduced during this era were the first =
commercial=20
 products to generate passive matrix recovery of ambient signals from=20
 conventional stereo recordings; the =
Dynaquad<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> system=20
 found its way into the QD-1 Quadaptor and the SCA-80Q "4-dimensional"=20
integrated  amplifier.  Late in the 1960s, Dynaco dropped another =
blockbuster in=20
the form of  the A-25 bookshelf loudspeaker, designed by SEAS Fabrikker =
in=20
Denmark and  imported by Dynaco. Praised as few other speakers in hi-fi =
history,=20
the A-25  went on to sell over a million units and spawn a line of up- =
and=20
down-scaled  systems to match the range of electronics offered by Dyna.=20
<P>In the 1970s, Dynaco made history again and again with a new series =
of=20
 solid-state units which continued the trend of maximum quality for the =
money.=20
Ed  Laurent moved over into management of the loudspeaker product line, =
handing=20
 solid state design over to a new generation of engineers that he hired =
in turn.=20
 Led by chief engineer Wade Burns, designers Erno Borbely, Jim =
Bongiorno, Harry=20
 Klaus, Hans Frank, Richard Pley, and others produced a stunning =
sequence of=20
 respectable equipment. Their FM-5 tuner, PAT-5 preamp and Stereo 400 =
power=20
 amplifier drew rave reviews from the critics, who mercilessly compared =
the new=20
 units to equipment several times their price and offered only minor =
criticisms.=20
 Dynaco's tube units continued to sell well into the 1970s, bolstered by =

 Laurent's last design -- the monoblock Mk. VI.  In fact, the Stereo 70 =
sold=20
 virtually without a break right up until 1990 (more about this later).  =
Audio=20
 Research Corporation offered retrofit kits for the Stereo 70 as part of =
their=20
 1970s line, and many many third-party modifications have sprung up =
around the=20
 infinitely versatile Dyna circuitry.  Dynaco's exemplary second- and=20
 third-generation solid state gear, such as the Stereo 150, QSA-300, =
ST-410,=20
 SE-10 equalizer and SCA-50, kept the mid-line alive even as the awesome =
Stereo=20
 416 (Wade Burns' 'maximized' ST-400 with more output transistors, a =
better=20
power  supply and meters than any similarly priced competing amplifier) =
revived=20
Dyna's  reputation as the audio leaders in 1977.=20
<P>In (1973?), Dynaco had moved from their Philadelphia home to nearby=20
 Blackwood, NJ where they remained until their demise.  Employees cited=20
 often-dangerous conditions in the surrounding Jefferson St. neigborhood =
and=20
 frequent vandalism as strong incentives for the move.  It was much =
safer and=20
 more conducive to operating a business in the new location, and Dynaco=20
 flourished.  Plans were laid for a follow-on series of advanced =
loudspeakers
 and another generation of solid-state gear, and the innovation =
continued.=20
<P>Dynaco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of <B>Tyco, Inc.</B> in 1969. =
 David=20
 Hafler remained with the company a few years longer, but left in 1974 =
to join =20
<B>Ortofon</B>, manufacturer and importer of high-end phono cartridges.  =
In=20
 1977, Hafler founded the <B>Hafler Company</B>, continuing the =
tradition of=20
high  quality but inexpensive kits and assembled hi-fi gear.  Former =
Dynaco=20
employees  Bob Tucker and Harry Klaus contributed their authorial and =
technical=20
expertise  to Hafler's cause at his new company.  In the mid-1980s, =
Hafler=20
developed the  straight-wire differential test (SWDT) for audio =
amplifiers, a=20
typically  straightforward and effective tool for evaluating linearity =
--=20
 proving that the man who founded Dynaco was still at the cutting edge.  =
Though=20
 the Hafler company is still a major player in high-end solid state =
equipment=20
for  audio and professional sound systems, David Hafler lost control of =
the=20
 organization which bears his name in a power struggle and has since =
retired.=20
<P>Tyco tried to revitalize the Dynaco name in the face of competition =
from=20
foreign  hi-fi manufacturers by encouraging the design of an all-new =
solid state=20
product  line and holding on-site repair/upgrade clinics at Dynaco's =
strongest=20
retailers.  The new product line suffered a tragic setback when the =
prototypes=20
were stolen  at the Atlanta Hi-Fi Show in the mid 70s, a loss that has =
not been=20
recovered or  adequately explained in 25 years.  Due to subsequent cash =
flow=20
problems, the new  components (featuring such equipment as the 2510=20
preamplifier, 2501 tuner, 2530  integrated amplifier and 2521 power amp) =
were=20
never produced.  Dynaco employees  of that era remember Tyco's =
acquisition for=20
an overall improvement in work  environment (due partially to the move) =
and=20
marketing, with many new product  ideas coming to fruition.  In spite of =
Tyco's=20
efforts, and record sales of their  sturdy equipment line, Dynaco's =
profits=20
began to slide and their once-preeminent  position among american hi-fi=20
manufacturers was in danger.  Rumors surfaced  concerning the possible =
sale of=20
Dynaco, and sure enough, the Dynaco holdings  were sold to <B>ESS =
Inc.</B> in=20
1979.=20
<P>ESS seemed puzzled as to what to do with the acquisition.  Anecdotal =
reports=20
 from the ESS era indicate that their management of Dynaco's assets was =
less=20
than  successful.  Dynaco, the company, closed its doors in 1980.  When =
ESS=20
decided to  unload their inventory, the Dynaco brand, parts and kits =
were picked=20
up by  <B>Stereo Cost Cutters/Sound Values Inc.</B> in Columbus OH.  =
SCC/SV=20
revived the  FM-5, AF-6, ST-150, SCA-50, SE-10, and ST410 kits without =
redesign=20
or parts  substitution. When original parts were exhausted, some of the =
units=20
ceased to be  available; others were repackaged with new metalwork, =
cases, etc.=20
and re-issued.   The Black Box 410 and Black Box Stereo 150 were =
examples of the=20
latter, which  stretched availability of those units into the 1980s; a =
few BB150=20
units were still available in 1990, when the author purchased his.=20
<P>Realizing that Dynaco tube units were becoming even more popular than =
the=20
 solid-state equipment, SCC/SV brought back the Mk. IV, PAS-3X and =
Stereo 70,=20
 which sold well until the last of the NOS Dynaco transformers, boards =
and=20
metalwork  were exhausted in the early 1990s.  They even managed to =
produce a=20
small run of  Mk. VI amps before their parts store ran out.  At this =
point, with=20
the original  Dynaco stock virtually gone, SCC/SV ended 14 years of =
Dynaco sales=20
and parts  support and turned their efforts toward designing new tube =
and=20
solid-state gear  for the enthusiasts. They still produce high-quality =
yet=20
relatively inexpensive  new components today under the name Sound =
Valves, though=20
they are unable to  provide parts or tech assistance for Dynaco =
equipment (for=20
obvious reasons!).=20
<P>In the late 1970s, Dynaco released a short-lived set of new =
loudspeakers=20
 developed under Ed Laurent's supervision before he departed to join =
SEAS=20
 Corporation.  The "Phase III" speakers were highly respected, but their =

 introduction was apparently too late to make any strong impression on =
the audio=20
 industry.  After Dynaco closed, another company (apparently the =
Canadian=20
 subsidiary, though the details are not clear; obviously someone still =
owned the=20
 Dyna branding for loudspeakers at that time) released the Dynaco A-150, =
A-250,=20
and  A-350 speakers which were manufactured in Canton, MA.  Reaction to =
these=20
units  was not favorable, and they disappeared from the review magazines =
in the=20
 mid-1980s.=20
<P>In the early 1990s, the Dynaco brand was picked up by <B>Pan Orient=20
 Corporation</B> (now <B>Panor Corporation</B>), which started selling =
original=20
 design equipment under the Dynaco brand; they offered the PAS-3 series =
II,=20
 PAS-4, CD player, and Stereo 80 tube power amp.  Panor still owns the =
Dynaco=20
 brand name, but any direct connection with the company founded by David =
Hafler=20
 has apparently ended for good.  On the other hand,  I have recently =
received=20
 information from Panor, indicating that they have re-opened their web =
site at=20
 www.dynaco.com, and that the Singapore web site is in no way affiliated =
with=20
the  company known as Panor Corporation or with the Dynaco brand.  =
Apparently=20
the  Dynaco brand will still be around for some time, and hopefully =
still be=20
 associated with high-quality low-cost stereo equipment (more products =
are=20
 promised in the near future).  I haven't had time to check out any of =
the  new=20
Panor equipment yet, though.  More news here as it is available.=20
<P>On a positive note, it is remarkable that many former Dynaco =
employees (from=20
the  Hafler era) are still in touch with one another; the fellowship and =
shared=20
 vision of the company extended into their private lives, and many of =
them are=20
 still using their 1960s-vintage equipment on a daily basis, as is the =
author of=20
 this web site.=20
<P>So what is the current status of Dynaco and support for the =
equipment?  None=20
of  the original principals are involved in support for Dyna equipment =
any more.=20
 There are a number of audio companies who sell upgrade kits and tech =
assistance=20
 for the tube equipment, but almost no one who still supports the =
solid-state=20
 amplifiers.  Part of the reason for my providing this web site is to =
make a=20
 rallying point for Dyna enthusiasts, in hope that we can pool our =
resources and=20
 make as much tech info available as possible, develop a network of =
shared=20
 schematics/troubleshooting info, etc.  So write me at the address below =
if you=20
 have any info to share; I will be building and updating a set of links =
to=20
assist  Dyna enthusiasts in keeping their equipment running well into =
the 21st=20
century!=20
<P>
<HR>

<HR>

<P>I would like to thank Wade Burns, James Elliott, John Ferranti, Doug =
Hercus,=20
Ed  Laurent, Richard Pley and Joseph Sparacio, former Dynaco employees, =
for=20
 contributing to the accuracy of this historical document and correcting =
my=20
 timeline of Dynaco's latter days.  Also thanks to Kevin Devaney and Dov =
Sassoon=20
 for recent info as regards the current state of Panor's holdings.  Any =
mistakes=20
 I have made interpreting their comments, or conclusions I have =
erroneously=20
 drawn, are my responsibility and not theirs.  As I receive further info =
from=20
 them and others, I will continue to improve the history page and add =
data to=20
the  component pages. It is clear from their passionate interest in =
accuracy=20
that  Dynaco's employees cared greatly about the company and each other, =
and it=20
has  been my privilege to hear their comments and share information from =
their=20
own  experiences at Dynaco with the world community.=20
<P>
<P>
<P>RIP: Harry Klaus, who contributed to many fine Dynaco products; Sid =
Lidz,=20
 designer of RF and power components; Bob Tucker, author of most of =
Dynaco's=20
 first-rate manuals; Bill Phillips, Dynaco's "golden ear" and customer  =
service=20
manager; and Joe Sparacio, technician.  They will be missed. </P>
